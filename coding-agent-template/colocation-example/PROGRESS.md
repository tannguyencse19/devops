# Current Session Progress

## Completed: Step 1 - Update PostgreSQL Schema for Defaults Analytics

Successfully transformed the PostgreSQL schema from approval analytics to defaults analytics in `/root/CODE/text-to-sql/scripts/phase-1/step-1-postgres-views/02_create_schema_and_tables.sql`.

### Schema Changes Completed:

1. **Restructured aloan table** - Now contains loan accounts information with origination data:
   - Changed from application_id to loan_account_id
   - Added origination_amount, term_months, interest_rate, current_outstanding_principal
   - Added vintage field for cohort analysis
   - 10 sample loan accounts across March-August 2024 vintages

2. **Added aloan_hist table** - SCD2 for loan account historical changes:
   - Tracks outstanding_principal, current_status, past_due_amount, days_past_due
   - Includes dpd_bucket, restructure_flag, bankruptcy_flag
   - Sample data showing progression to default for LOAN002 and LOAN007

3. **Replaced rloan table** - Now contains repayment schedule information:
   - Changed from rejections to repayment schedules
   - Fields: schedule_id, loan_account_id, installment_number, due_date, due_principal, due_interest, due_fees
   - Sample monthly installment schedules for active and defaulted loans

4. **Updated tloan table** - Now contains loan transaction information:
   - Changed from final approvals to transaction history
   - Fields: txn_id, loan_account_id, txn_date, amount, txn_type, external_ref
   - Sample payment transactions showing regular payments, partial payments, and missed payments

5. **Added default_policy table** - Product-specific default definitions:
   - Configurable DPD threshold (90 days), restructure/bankruptcy flags
   - Cooloff period (30 days) to avoid oscillations
   - Sample policy for Personal loan products

### Sample Data Structure:
- **10 loan accounts** with various channels (foodpanda, atome, fsa)
- **2 defaulted loans** (LOAN002, LOAN007) with 90+ days past due
- **2 delinquent loans** (LOAN005, LOAN009) in 61-90 DPD bucket
- **Vintage distribution** across March-August 2024 for trend analysis
- **Payment history** showing progression from current to default status

### Technical Implementation:
- All tables maintain TIMESTAMPTZ columns for incremental refresh
- Foreign key relationships established between tables
- Proper indexes for performance including updated_at columns
- Triggers for automatic timestamp maintenance
- Audit columns (created_at, updated_at) for all tables

## Completed: Step 2 - Create Loan Defaults Analytics Views

   - Includes loan origination details (product_type, channel, vintage, origination_amount)
   - Calculates performance indicators (is_default, is_delinquent, is_current, months_on_book)
   - Supports monthly performance tracking and vintage analysis

2. **fact_default_event** - First default events per loan:
   - Identifies first default events based on policy (90+ DPD, bankruptcy, restructure)
   - Fields: loan_account_id, default_date, trigger_type, exposure_at_default, dpd_at_default
   - Includes origination details (vintage, product_type, channel, credit_score, applicant_age)
   - Calculates default timing (Early_Default, Mid_Default, Late_Default) and exposure_ratio
   - Supports "How many customers defaulted in last 3 months" queries

3. **vw_defaults_monthly_summary** - Monthly defaults aggregation for QuickSight:
   - Combines default events with active loan metrics for comprehensive reporting
   - Metrics: defaults_count, default_rate, balance_at_default, balance_default_rate
   - Breakdown by trigger type (dpd_defaults, bankruptcy_defaults, restructure_defaults)
   - Breakdown by timing (early_defaults, mid_defaults, late_defaults)
   - Includes active_loans, total_outstanding, current_loans, delinquent_loans
   - Time-based labels (month_label, year, month) for QuickSight visualization

4. **vw_defaults_mom_attribution** - Month-over-month change attribution:
   - Supports "What drove change versus prior month" queries
   - Volume/Rate/Mix attribution analysis with volume_effect and rate_effect
   - Channel attribution showing top contributing channels to change

### QuickSight Dataset Testing Results:

**SUCCESS**: The updated QuickSight dataset creation script works correctly:
- Dataset "phase1-defaults-analytics-dataset" created successfully
- Physical table mapping updated to "vw_defaults_monthly_summary" 
- All 19 defaults analytics columns properly configured with correct data types
- Logical table transformations for DECIMAL/FLOAT casting applied correctly
- Incremental refresh configuration preserved (15-minute schedule, 1-day lookback)

**Expected Ingestion Failure**: The SPICE ingestion failed as expected with:
```
ERROR: relation "loan_analytics.vw_defaults_monthly_summary" does not exist
```

This confirms the dataset configuration is correct but requires the database schema to be properly set up with the defaults analytics views.

### Technical Validation:

**QuickSight Integration**: 
- Data source "phase1-postgres-datasource" exists and functional
- VPC connection properly configured for secure RDS access
