# Process

- Step 1: Receive requirements <TODO: Insert Anirban document>
- Step 2: Create a proposal - High-level Architecture Components, example flow; Low-level Architecture Components; Cost; Man-time estimations; Require information provide
- Step 3: Review proposal

NOTES: Clients can abuse us to just get proposal and never contact back

# Reason to delay time

- First time do --> Don't know how long it take to communicate cross team --> Can't estimate shorter
- Spend many time mostly on initial setup
- Spend many time to setup correctly so that the output is correct. Maybe because not setup properly lead to under expectation result, rather than because of the product itself
