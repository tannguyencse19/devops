# Coolify Self-Hosting Installation

This directory contains an automated installation script for self-hosting Coolify on localhost, an open-source alternative to Heroku, Netlify, and Vercel.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run the installation script
sudo ./INSTALL.sh
# You will be prompted to enter your admin email address
```

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- **OS**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or 24.04 LTS (64-bit)
- **RAM**: Minimum 4GB (8GB+ recommended)
- **Disk**: Minimum 20GB available space
- **Network**: Internet connection for downloading packages

### Before Running the Script
1. **Root Access**: The script must be run with sudo or as root user
2. **Internet Connection**: Required for downloading Docker and Coolify components

## What the Script Does

### Phase 1: System Validation & Setup
- ‚úÖ Validates system requirements (RAM, disk, OS)
- ‚úÖ Updates system packages
- ‚úÖ Installs required dependencies
- ‚úÖ Configures firewall (UFW)
- ‚úÖ Installs Docker

### Phase 2: Security Hardening
- üîí Configures SSH security (key-based auth only)
- üîí Sets up fail2ban for intrusion detection
- üîí Generates secure passwords and secrets
- üîí Hardens system settings

### Phase 3: Coolify Installation
- üöÄ Downloads and installs Coolify
- üöÄ Configures environment variables
- üöÄ Sets up localhost access on port 8000
- üöÄ Creates admin user account

### Phase 4: Monitoring & Maintenance
- üìä Sets up system monitoring (every 5 minutes)
- üíæ Configures daily automated backups
- üõ†Ô∏è Creates maintenance scripts
- üìã Generates detailed installation report

## Usage

Simply run the script as root:

```bash
sudo ./INSTALL.sh
```

The script will prompt you for:
- Admin email address (validated for proper format)

No command-line arguments needed!

## Troubleshooting

### Installation Issues

1. **Port conflicts**
   ```bash
   # Check what's using ports 80/443/8000
   netstat -tulpn | grep -E ':80|:443|:8000'
   ```

3. **Docker issues**
   ```bash
   # Check Docker status
   systemctl status docker
   docker --version
   ```

### Access Issues

1. **Can't access dashboard**
   - Verify firewall allows ports 80/443/8000
   - Check if Coolify containers are running
   - Try accessing `http://localhost:8000` directly

2. **Forgot admin password**
   - Check installation report: `/root/coolify-installation-report.txt`
   - Reset via Coolify interface or database

### Log Locations

- Installation: `/var/log/coolify-install.log`
- Monitoring: `/var/log/coolify-monitor.log`
