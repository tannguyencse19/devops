# 🎯 Final Manual Steps - API Limitations Encountered

## 📋 **Current Situation**

### ✅ **What We've Confirmed:**
1. **PostgreSQL service**: Running and healthy
2. **Port mapping configured**: `5710:5432` in Docker Compose
3. **Manual restart attempted**: Service restarted via dashboard
4. **API limitations**: Cannot update environment variables via API

### ❌ **Remaining Issue:**
- **Port 5710**: Still not exposed to host system despite configuration
- **Coolify container management**: Uses isolated Docker runtime
- **API endpoints**: Environment variable updates return "Not found"

## 🚀 **Final Solution (Manual Dashboard)**

Since both API methods failed, you need to complete this in the Coolify dashboard:

### **Step 1: Switch to Internal Networking**

1. **Go to**: https://coolify.timothynguyen.work
2. **Navigate to**: Applications → metabase-app → Configuration → Environment Variables
3. **Update these 2 variables**:

   **Change:**
   ```
   MB_DB_HOST: From "91.99.53.200" 
   To: "postgres-tkc0s408ws00ckc4o88swc0s"
   
   MB_DB_PORT: From "5710"
   To: "5432"
   ```

4. **Click**: Save → Deploy
5. **Wait**: 2-3 minutes for deployment

### **Step 2: Verify Success**

After deployment completes:
```bash
./VERIFY_APPLICATION.sh
```

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ **Metabase status**: Changes to `running:healthy`
- ✅ **Port 5700**: Becomes active and responding
- ✅ **Connection tests**: Successful
- 🌐 **Access**: `http://91.99.53.200:5700`

## 💡 **Why Internal Networking Works**

- **Direct container communication**: No host port dependency
- **Docker DNS resolution**: Container names resolve automatically
- **Network isolation**: Containers on same Docker network can communicate
- **Reliable**: Doesn't depend on Coolify's port mapping implementation

## 🎉 **Final Architecture**

Once working:
- **PostgreSQL**: Internal container `postgres-tkc0s408ws00ckc4o88swc0s:5432`
- **Metabase**: Accessible at `http://91.99.53.200:5700`
- **Domain setup**: Available in Coolify for SSL access
- **Container networking**: Fully isolated and secure

## 🔧 **If Still Having Issues**

If internal networking doesn't work either, the issue might be:
1. **Container network isolation**: Containers not on same network
2. **Service startup timing**: PostgreSQL not ready when Metabase starts
3. **DNS resolution**: Container hostname not resolving

**In that case, we'd need to investigate Coolify's Docker network setup further.**

**The manual environment variable change should resolve this - it's the most reliable approach given the API limitations!** 🚀
