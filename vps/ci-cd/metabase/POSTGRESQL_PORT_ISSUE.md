# 🔧 PostgreSQL Port Issue - API Restart Attempted

## 📊 **What I Found & Did:**

### ✅ **Discovered:**
1. **Port mapping exists** in Docker Compose: `"ports": "5710:5432"` ✓
2. **Service is healthy**: `"status": "running (healthy)"` ✓
3. **API restart queued**: `"Service restarting request queued."` ✓

### ❌ **Still Not Working:**
- **Port 5710**: Still not active on host system
- **Container visibility**: PostgreSQL container not visible in standard `docker ps`
- **Network connectivity**: Cannot connect to `91.99.53.200:5710`

## 🎯 **Root Cause Analysis**

The Coolify service has the correct port mapping configuration, but it's not being applied to the actual running container. This suggests:

1. **Container Management**: Coolify uses a different Docker context/runtime
2. **Network Isolation**: The container might be in an isolated network
3. **Restart Issue**: The API restart might not have fully recreated the container

## 🚀 **Manual Fix Required (Dashboard)**

Since the API method didn't work, you'll need to use the Coolify dashboard:

### **Step 1: Stop & Recreate Service**
1. Go to: https://coolify.timothynguyen.work
2. Navigate to: **Services** → **metabase-db**
3. Click **"Stop"** button
4. Wait for service to fully stop
5. Click **"Start"** button 
6. Wait for container to start with port mapping

### **Step 2: Verify Port Configuration**
In the service settings, confirm:
- **Port Mapping**: `5710:5432` is configured
- **Network Mode**: Check if it's set to bridge/host mode
- **External Access**: Ensure external access is enabled

### **Step 3: Alternative - Use Internal Networking**
If port mapping continues to fail:

1. **Go to**: Applications → metabase-app → Environment Variables
2. **Change back to internal networking**:
   ```
   MB_DB_HOST = postgres-tkc0s408ws00ckc4o88swc0s
   MB_DB_PORT = 5432
   ```
3. **Save & Deploy**

## 🔍 **Testing Commands**

After any changes, test with:
```bash
# Check port status
netstat -tuln | grep 5710

# Test PostgreSQL connectivity
nc -z 91.99.53.200 5710

# Verify Metabase application
./VERIFY_APPLICATION.sh
```

## 💡 **Why Internal Networking Might Work Better**

Docker's internal networking often works more reliably than port forwarding because:
- **Direct container-to-container communication**
- **No dependency on host port mapping**
- **Automatic DNS resolution within Docker network**

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Try manual stop/start** in Coolify dashboard first
2. **If that fails**, switch to internal networking approach
3. **Test with verification script** after each attempt

The configuration is correct, but Coolify's container runtime needs to be refreshed to apply the port mapping! 🔄
