# üîç Detailed Log Analysis - Metabase Connection Issue

## üìã **Key Findings from Logs**

### ‚úÖ **Good News**
1. **Metabase starts successfully** - JVM loads, gets 956MB memory
2. **Encryption warning is just informational** - Not the core issue
3. **Application structure loads** - All Clojure modules initialize

### üö® **Real Issue Identified**

**Primary Error:**
```
java.net.UnknownHostException: postgres-tkc0s408ws00ckc4o88swc0s
```

**Root Cause:**
```
Caused by: org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: The connection attempt failed.
at org.postgresql.core.v3.ConnectionFactoryImpl.openConnectionImpl
```

**Detailed Chain:**
1. Metabase tries to connect to PostgreSQL during startup
2. DNS resolution fails for `postgres-tkc0s408ws00ckc4o88swc0s`  
3. Connection factory can't establish TCP connection
4. Application initialization fails completely

## üéØ **The Encryption Warning is NOT the Issue**

The log shows:
```
INFO util.encryption :: Saved credentials encryption is DISABLED for this Metabase instance. üîì
For more information, see https://metabase.com/docs/latest/operations-guide/encrypting-database-details-at-rest.html
```

**This is just informational** - Metabase works fine without encryption enabled. The link was provided for future security hardening, not as an error to fix.

## üîß **Real Problem: Hostname Resolution**

### Current Environment Variables:
- `MB_DB_HOST=postgres-tkc0s408ws00ckc4o88swc0s` ‚ùå
- `MB_DB_PORT=5432` ‚ùå (should be 5710 for external access)

### Why This Fails:
1. **Container Name Incorrect**: The hostname `postgres-tkc0s408ws00ckc4o88swc0s` doesn't exist in Docker networking
2. **Port Mismatch**: Using internal port 5432 instead of external 5710
3. **Network Isolation**: Metabase application can't resolve service hostnames

## üöÄ **Correct Solutions**

### Option 1: Use Server IP (Recommended)
```bash
MB_DB_HOST=91.99.53.200
MB_DB_PORT=5710
```

### Option 2: Use Correct Container Name
```bash
MB_DB_HOST=metabase-db-tkc0s408ws00ckc4o88swc0s
MB_DB_PORT=5432
```

### Option 3: Use localhost (if same host)
```bash
MB_DB_HOST=localhost
MB_DB_PORT=5710
```

## üìä **Log Pattern Confirmation**

The error repeats multiple times showing:
1. **Connection Pool Exhaustion**: `A ResourcePool could not acquire a resource`
2. **Consistent Hostname Failure**: Always `UnknownHostException: postgres-tkc0s408ws00ckc4o88swc0s`
3. **No Network Connectivity**: TCP connection never establishes

## ‚úÖ **Next Steps**

1. **Change environment variables** in Coolify dashboard
2. **Redeploy application** to pick up new settings  
3. **Monitor logs** for successful database connection
4. **Access Metabase** once connection succeeds

**The encryption link was a red herring - the real issue is hostname resolution!** üéØ
