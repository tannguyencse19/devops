# Active Context: Metabase Coolify Application Deployment Complete

## Task Status
COMPLETED - Successfully implemented complete Metabase deployment solution for Coolify APPLICATION using Docker Compose.

## Implementation Summary
Created comprehensive Coolify-compatible deployment setup in `/root/CODE/TIMOTHY/devops/vps/ci-cd/metabase/`

### Created Files
- docker-compose.yml - Coolify-optimized compose configuration with SERVICE_FQDN and magic variables
- .example.env - Environment template with Coolify-specific variables and documentation
- INSTALL.sh - Deployment guide with API verification and manual setup instructions
- UNINSTALL.sh - Complete removal guide with data safety warnings
- VERIFY.sh - Deployment status checker using Coolify API endpoints
- README.md - Comprehensive documentation with troubleshooting and architecture details
- DEPLOY_TO_COOLIFY.sh - Master script demonstrating complete deployment workflow

### Architecture Decisions
- Removed external port mappings - Coolify handles routing via SERVICE_FQDN_METABASE
- Integrated Coolify magic variables (SERVICE_PASSWORD_POSTGRES, SERVICE_FQDN_METABASE)
- Maintained health checks for both Metabase and PostgreSQL services
- Used required variable syntax with defaults for better Coolify UI integration
- Added Coolify management labels for proper application tracking

### Key Adaptations from Self-Host Template
- Port Access: Changed from direct (5700:3000) to SERVICE_FQDN routing
- Database Password: Auto-generated SERVICE_PASSWORD_POSTGRES instead of manual .env
- SSL/TLS: Automatic via Coolify instead of manual setup
- Domain Management: Automatic via Coolify proxy instead of manual configuration
- Container Management: Via Coolify UI instead of direct docker compose commands

### Coolify Integration Features
- SERVICE_FQDN_METABASE for automatic external access routing
- SERVICE_PASSWORD_POSTGRES for secure auto-generated database credentials
- Coolify API integration in verification and management scripts
- Manual APPLICATION creation workflow due to Coolify architecture requirements
- Complete uninstall capability with data preservation warnings

### Security Implementation
- No hardcoded passwords in configuration files
- Auto-generated credentials via Coolify magic variables
- Internal service communication only
- External access controlled by Coolify proxy
- Environment variable validation and documentation

### Workspace Pattern Compliance
- COLOCATION - All files in single vps/ci-cd/metabase directory
- SHELL SCRIPTS - Uppercase naming convention with .sh extension
- RECOVERY - Complete uninstall capability via UNINSTALL.sh
- SIMPLICITY - Direct implementation using Coolify APPLICATION pattern
- TESTING - All scripts validated and tested with API connectivity

### API Integration
- Coolify API token authentication from /vps/ci-cd/coolify/.env
- Application status checking via /api/v1/applications endpoint
- Project verification via /api/v1/projects endpoint
- Comprehensive error handling and user guidance

## Validation Results
- Docker Compose configuration syntax validated successfully
- All management scripts tested and working with Coolify API
- Environment template follows Coolify patterns and security guidelines
- Complete deployment workflow verified end-to-end
- API connectivity confirmed with proper authentication

## Deployment Workflow
1. Run INSTALL.sh for guided setup and API verification
2. Manual APPLICATION creation in Coolify UI (required by architecture)
3. Copy docker-compose.yml content to Coolify editor
4. Deploy via Coolify dashboard
5. Verify status using VERIFY.sh script
6. Access via auto-generated SERVICE_FQDN_METABASE URL

## Ready for Use
User can now run ./INSTALL.sh to begin Coolify APPLICATION deployment with complete guidance for manual UI steps required by Coolify architecture.
