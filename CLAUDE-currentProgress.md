# Active Context: Metabase Self-Host Implementation Complete

## Task Status
COMPLETED - Successfully implemented complete Metabase self-host solution following workspace patterns.

## Implementation Summary
Created comprehensive Docker Compose setup for Metabase with PostgreSQL in `/root/CODE/TIMOTHY/devops/self-host-template/metabase/`

### Created Files
- docker-compose.yml - Main orchestration with Metabase + PostgreSQL services
- .example.env - Environment variables template with security placeholders
- INSTALL.sh - Complete installation script with health checks and user guidance
- UNINSTALL.sh - Complete cleanup script with confirmation and data removal
- START.sh - Service management script with status monitoring
- STOP.sh - Graceful service stopping with data preservation
- README.md - Comprehensive documentation

### Architecture Decisions
- Port 5700 for Metabase Web UI (mapped from internal 3000)
- Port 5710 for PostgreSQL external access
- PostgreSQL 15-alpine for production database
- Named Docker volumes for data persistence
- Health checks for both services
- Proper dependency management

### Security Implementation
- Environment variables for all secrets
- No hardcoded passwords in files
- Placeholder format for sensitive values
- Clear documentation of secret key names only

### Workspace Pattern Compliance
- COLOCATION - All files in single directory
- SHELL SCRIPTS - Uppercase naming convention with .sh extension
- RECOVERY - Complete uninstall capability
- SIMPLICITY - Direct implementation without over-engineering

## Validation Results
- Docker Compose configuration validated successfully
- All management scripts created with proper permissions
- Environment template follows security guidelines
- Complete recovery cycle implemented

## Ready for Use
User can now run ./INSTALL.sh to deploy complete Metabase solution
