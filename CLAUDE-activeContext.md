# Active Context: Coolify Environment Variables Automation

## Current Status:  COMPLETED

The **COOLIFY-ENV-SYNC.sh** script has been successfully implemented and tested at `/root/CODE/TIMOTHY/devops/vps/ci-cd/secrets/COOLIFY-ENV-SYNC.sh`.

###  What Was Accomplished

1. **Script Implementation**: Created complete automation script with all required features:
   - Takes `<APP_NAME>` as argument
   - Automatically finds secrets file: `<APP_NAME>.env`  
   - Sources Coolify API token from `../coolify/.env`
   - Discovers Coolify application via API
   - Syncs environment variables with proper flags

2. **API Integration**: Successfully integrated with Coolify API:
   - **Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/applications/{uuid}/envs`
   - **Authentication**: Bearer token (`GITHUBB_TIMOTHYNGUYEN_COOLIFY_GITHUB_ACTION_API_TOKEN`)
   - **Payload Format**: `{key, value, is_build_time, is_preview, is_literal}`
   - **Create/Update Logic**: Handles both new variables (POST) and existing variables (PATCH via 409 handling)

3. **Variable Processing**: Correctly processes environment variables:
   -  `VITE_*` prefixed keys set `is_build_time=true`
   -  All other keys set `is_build_time=false`
   -  Validates required `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` exists

4. **Testing Results**: Successfully tested with `demo-develop-app-with-tdd` application:
   -  Application found: UUID `vos0o4ks08044sgokcgosgsw`
   -  Variable created/updated: `VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://dieaqijwqrtchfffhrvs.supabase.co`
   -  Proper build-time flag set (`is_build_time=true`)

### <¯ Final Working Command
