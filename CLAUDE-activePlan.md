# Active Plan: Self-Host Metabase

## Overview
Create a complete self-hosting solution for Metabase business intelligence platform using Docker Compose.

## Plan Parts
1. **Setup Infrastructure** (Current)
   - Directory structure
   - Docker Compose configuration with PostgreSQL
   - Environment variables management
   
2. **Management Scripts**
   - Installation and uninstallation scripts
   - Start/stop/restart scripts
   - Health checking

3. **Documentation & Testing**
   - Comprehensive README
   - Testing the complete setup process

## Current Status
- **Part 1/3**: Setup Infrastructure - In Progress
- Working on directory structure and Docker Compose configuration

## Architecture Decisions
- Using Docker Compose for orchestration (simpler than Kubernetes for single-host)
- PostgreSQL as external database (production-ready vs default H2)
- Environment file approach for configuration
- Script-based management following established patterns
